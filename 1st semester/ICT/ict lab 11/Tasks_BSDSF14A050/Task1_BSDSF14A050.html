<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">HTML THE HARD WAY</h1>
<p>I stand by my method of teaching HTML the old-fashioned way-by hand. There's no beter way to truly understand how markup works than typing it out, one tag at a time, then opening your page in a browser. It doesn't take long to develop a feel for marking up documents properly.</p>
<p>Although you may choose to use a web-authoring tool down the line, understanding HTML will make using your tools easier and more efficient. In addition, you will be glad that you can look at a source file and understand what you're seeing. It is also crucial for troubleshooting broken pages or fine-tuning the default formatting that web tools produce.</p>
<p>And for what it's worth,professional web deelopers tend to mark up content manually because it gives them better control over the code and allows them to make detiberate decisions about what elements are used.</p>
