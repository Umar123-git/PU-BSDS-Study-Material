Formatting using the ios members:

The stream has the format flags that control the way of formatting it means Using this setf function, we can set the flags, which allow us to display a value in a particular format. The ios class declares a bitmask enumeration called fmtflags in which the values(showbase, showpoint, oct, hex etc) are defined. These values are used to set or clear the format flags.

Few standard ios class functions are:

width(): The width method is used to set the required field width. The output will be displayed in the given width
precision(): The precision method is used to set the number of the decimal point to a float value
fill(): The fill method is used to set a character to fill in the blank space of a field
setf(): The setf method is used to set various flags for formatting output
unsetf(): The unsetf method is used To remove the flag setting

===========================================

Formatting using Manipulators

The second way you can alter the format parameters of a stream is through the use of special functions called manipulators that can be included in an I/O expression.

The standard manipulators are shown below:

boolalpha: The boolalpha manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to turn on bool alpha flag
dec: The dec manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to turn on the dec flag
endl: The endl manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Output a newline character.
and: The and manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Flush the stream
ends: The ends manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Output a null
fixed: The fixed manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns on the fixed flag
flush: The flush manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Flush a stream
hex: The hex manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns on hex flag
internal: The internal manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns on internal flag
left: The left manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns on the left flag
noboolalpha: The noboolalpha manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns off bool alpha flag
noshowbase: The noshowbase manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns off showcase flag
noshowpoint: The noshowpoint manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns off show point flag
noshowpos: The noshowpos manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns off showpos flag
noskipws: The noskipws manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns off skipws flag
nounitbuf: The nounitbuf manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns off the unit buff flag
nouppercase: The nouppercase manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns off the uppercase flag
oct: The oct manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns on oct flag
resetiosflags(fmtflags f): The resetiosflags manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns off the flag specified in f
right: The right manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns on the right flag
scientific: The scientific manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns on scientific flag
setbase(int base): The setbase manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Set the number base to base
setfill(int ch): The setfill manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Set the fill character to ch
setiosflags(fmtflags f): The setiosflags manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns on the flag specified in f
setprecision(int p): The setprecision manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Set the number of digits of precision
setw(int w): The setw manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Set the field width to w
showbase: The showbase manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns on showbase flag
showpoint: The showpoint manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns on show point flag
showpos: The showpos manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns on showpos flag
skipws: The skipws manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to Turns on skipws flag
unitbuf: The unitbuf manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to turn on unitbuf flag
uppercase: The uppercase manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to turn on the uppercase flag
ws: The ws manipulator of stream manipulators in C++ is used to skip leading white space

To access manipulators that take parameters (such as setw( )), you must include “iomanip” header file in your program.
